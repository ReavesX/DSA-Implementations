Description: Linked List implementation and example usage.


Notes:
             -- A linked list is a data structure which lets you efficiently insert and delete arrays. 
             -- Linked Lists are used to implement Stacks, Queues, and Deques
             

            Characteristics:
             -- Non-Contiguous: Elements may be not touching or connected. I.E. there are multiple blocks of memory at different addresses, 
                                Head Node (Data, Link) - > Node 1 (Data, Link) -> Node N (Data, Link) -> NULL
            -- Accessed Sequentially, 

            Types of Linked Lists:
             -- Doubly Linked List
             -- Singly Linked List
             -- Circular Linked List
             
             
            Typical Operations:
             -- Length
             -- Print
             -- Insert
             -- Search
             -- Delete Key
             -- Delete Given Position
             -- Delete List
             -- Get Nth Node from Start
             -- Get Nth Node from End
             -- Size of Doubly Linked List
